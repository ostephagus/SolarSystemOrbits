# SolarSystemOrbits
A repository for the BPhO computational challenge entry 2023.
ToDos and project management is in the projects tab.

## Plan
### UI framework in WPF
- Use MVVM design pattern (UI as view, backend C++ as model, intermediate C# code as ViewModel)
- Home screen to select tasks
- Adaptive changing variables
- Use LiveCharts until it is insufficient (hehe) - hopefully it can animate as well
### Backend computation in C++ (for earlier challenges) or CUDA, built along with c# for intercommunication with UI
### Overleaf for paper - this will describe our computational solution
